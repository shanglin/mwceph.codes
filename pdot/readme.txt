1. make all the v-band observations and b-band observations and write them to files.

2. Try to build a model with constantly changing frequency but it does not work. It seems that the period does not change in that way.

3. make all the all-band observations.

4. Fit Pejcha's model using data sliced by time, record the periods for each MJD range. Check how the period changed.
It turns out that some data points around MJD~50000 looks weird.

5. Check data. The data inconsistency spoils the periodogram... Maybe
use ASAS data only for those who have.

##########  Group data, Calculate P and sigma P for each group:

McMaster <70s, Mc 80s, Mc 90s, ASAS, iomc

6. combine data with their types
