1. make raw lc with good observations, including north cepheids
    mjd, m, e
    mkrawlc.r
  This procedure is going to reject those points with very large uncertainties and bad observations for ND4 observations.

2. make exposure time

3. calnd4.r
   Calculate the ND4 factor based on each data points rather than the mean mag of light curves. 

4. make a quality table to determine H/N
