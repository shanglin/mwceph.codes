(1) Most work of period search was done previous, and their results was put at:
~/Work/mega/mwceph/pphot/period_all/ehat.dat.part1 

(2) There are 6 recent objects left. They were triggered later than the first reduction. They are:
sy_nor
vj_ara
w_sgr
sv_vel
cr_car
s_nor

(3) In this directory, we will deal with these above 6 objects.

===========================================
Order of ./period_all/:

(1) getper.py will pull out the GCVS period. Interestingly CR ARA has a period of 0.50096 days based on GCVS.

(2) Collecting data. This is boring and time-consuming. 
    Manually search good observations at: http://crocus.physics.mcmaster.ca/Cepheid/Classical.html
    Filter number based on: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/748/2/107/pdf
    Paper downloaded and saved at: ~/Work/mega/mwceph/pphot/period_all/model_paper.pdf

(3) slc2ipt.py will make initial input at /model_per/inputs_it1/

(4) in /model_per/calphat_it1/:
    copy ~/Work/mega/mwceph/period_search/calphat_it1/period .
    copy ~/Work/mega/mwceph/period_search/calphat_it1/vector.dat .
    copy ~/Work/mega/mwceph/period_search/calphat_it1/template.dat .
    copy ~/Work/mega/mwceph/period_search/calphat_it1/bindat01.com .
    copy ~/Work/mega/mwceph/period_search/calphat_it1/mkit1sh.r .
    run Rscript mkit1sh.r
    run tcsh doit1all.sh
    Paramters in period: 
    	      wl_Prange = 1.5 ! This will test from P0 - PR/2 to P0 + PR/2
	      wl_Rfactor = 2
 	      nphase = 3
    output:
       <obj>_chi_sqr.dat
    mkperlst_it1_it2.r will make a new period estimation file in input_it2/

(5) in /model_per/inputs_it2/:
    run python slc2ipt.py to generate new .ipt files

(6) in /model_per/calphat_it2/:
